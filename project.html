		<h1>Dronacharya</h1>
		<p>
		Dronacharya was a drone-automation workshop held in January, 2020. This was held by the Aerodynamics Club of Bits Goa. It was a two day long workshop. On the first day we had a guest lecture where the speaker spoke about his journey and his enthusiasm towards aviation. On the next day, first half was completely spent on understanding the physics of how it works and basic terminologies. In the second half, we assemmbled all the parts. I did soldering for the first time then. Once the drone was ready, we automated the drone. Seniors were a great help throughout.

	<h1>Consultathon</h1>
		<p>In June'2020, I had taken part in a consultation competition conducted by 180 DC in collaboration with Bits Goa Consulting Club. The participants had to solve real-time problems of different sectors and provide them with a strategic plan to grow their business. My team was able to make it in the top 20 out of 105 registered teams. It was great push for me start off with consulting. I created the presentation for all the four cases which gave me a great experience to work with Microsoft PowerPoint. I also got to know about the different types of frameworks like Porter's Analysis, 4Ps, 3Cs, etc.<br>Below are the three cases that I have worked on with my team.</p>

	<h1>Quark Summer Technical Project: Photo and Video Editing</h1>
		<p>
		Quark Summer Technical Projects(QSTP) are crash sources in different fields. By taking up this Editing course I got a push to start using Digital softwares like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere Pro. I am also a part of the design team in a few departments of my college. My job is to make posters for the upcoming events or write-ups. As a part of farewell for the senior batch, I made half of the result declaring videos for the Nareal Awards.<br>
		This was one of my posters I made during the course.
